This is a small project, built as a basic food ordering app using React Native combined with Tailwind CSS to create a simple and user-friendly interface. The project includes basic features such as page navigation and image loading. Additionally, the website integrates Redux Toolkit to implement increment and decrement functions and uses Sanity to generate image data for the website.
